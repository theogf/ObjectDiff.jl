"""
An `AtomicDiff` is a leaf in the diff tree, i.e. it does not have any children differences.
`AtomicDiff` subtypes should implement:
- `Base.first(::AtomicDiff)`: the left element
- `Base.last(::AtomicDiff)`: the right element

Subtypes can also implement the `diff_prefix(::IO, ::AtomicDiff)` to print some additional prefix.
